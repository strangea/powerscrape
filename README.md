# powerscrape
A Pastebin scraper written in PowerShell. Made some changes to a similar script to better fit PowerShell best practices.
It is still very rough around the edges! 

To use, you will need to create a regex.txt, seen.txt, and a folder named found in the same directory as the script.
The script will pull from pastebin.com/archive, scrape it for unique links, and then search them for each regex entry in regex.txt.
